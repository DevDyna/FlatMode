# FlatMode - Superflat Challenge

This map is inspired from video of Yeah Jaron (100 days on a superflat world) but with many changes , twist and more progress on game by me

<Logo placeholder>

 

A simple survival on a superflat (no structures) with 58+ quests (advancements) to help on progression to obtain resources!

You start with a kit (a crafting table and a chest) and opening advancement tab you can check your progress

 

What change from the original (video) and this world?

- Quests to help without going to find wikipages or other

- Rewards not overpowered but can give help on progression

- Unique feathure to obtain the impossible on survival (nether and end)


  This map can be played with vanilla client , all functional stuff are totally vanilla
